## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set" error**
   - Make sure you've created a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Verify your API key is correct and active

2. **Voice recording not working**
   - Ensure you have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your `.env` file
   - Check browser permissions for microphone access

3. **Import failing for large CSV files**
   - The system processes files in chunks for better performance
   - For very large files (10k+ contacts), the import may take a few minutes
